## Accepted assay format 

Accepted formats include a 10 point serial dilution of 2-3 replicates in either 96 or 384 well plates. The exact format will dictate how many positions (pos_x) are available on the plate. The available positions for each format are shown below:

![96 well layout options.](layout_96w.png){width=700px}

![384 well layout options.](layout_384w.png){width=700px}


batchCurve comes bundled with a number of example dose-response sample files: 

```{r}
# lists the names of available example data files
batchCurve_example()
```



## Meta data requirments

**Example_meta.csv** contains the meta data that describe the assays and plate contents, here one row represent one assay:

* <span style="color: orange;">**Plate ID**</span> variable to link meta with the plate file of raw measurements
* <span style="color: red;">**Location data**</span> describing the format and positions on the plate each assay sits
* <span style="color: blue;">**Treatment and cell ID**</span> information
* <span style="color: purple;">**Dose range**</span> information

```{r example_data, echo = TRUE, results = 'hide'}
f <- batchCurve_example("example_meta.csv")
f
```

```{r example_data formatting, echo=FALSE}
#f <- batchCurve_example("example_meta.csv")
border <- flextable::fp_border_default()
flextable::flextable(head(utils::read.csv(f))) %>%
  flextable::color(j = c("plate_id"), color = "orange", part = "header") %>%
  flextable::color(j = 2:4, color = "red", part = "header") %>%
  flextable::color(j = 5:7, color = "blue", part = "header") %>%
  flextable::color(j = 8:9, color = "purple", part = "header") %>%  
  flextable::vline(j = c('plate_id','replicates', 'cell'), 
                   border = border, part = "all") %>% 
  flextable::bold(j = 1:9, bold = TRUE, part = "header") %>% flextable::fontsize(size = 10) %>%
  flextable::align(align = "center")

```

* The column names of the meta file rely of exact text matching, so its best to work from a template file.

* All assays on the same plate must be setup with the same number of replicates, but formats between plates in the same batch can be different, i.e the meta could include a 384 well plate in triplicate containing 10 assays as well as a 96 well plate in duplicate containing 3 assays.

* You can filter the meta data if you wish to exclude certain assays.

## Raw data format requirements

The analysis pipeline was developed to be compatible with an Omega Fluostar plate reader  csv output (ASCII), which includes 3 required components:

1. Data stored in files with a prefix - **'TRno'** or **'automated'**.

```{r}
#look at one of the raw data file examples
f <- batchCurve_example("TRno3735.CSV")
```

2. An **ID** variable set when reading the plate which matches the plate_id in the meta file (Omega prefixes with 'ID1:'). This should be in row 3 column 1 of raw data csv and must match exactly you meta file plate_ID name.

```{r}
#batchCurve looks in row 3 column 1 for ID variable
utils::read.csv(f, nrow = 3, header = FALSE)[3,1]
```

3. Raw read data in plate format where well A01 begins in row 10, column 1 of the file.

```{r}
# showing file from row 9
head(utils::read.csv(f, skip = 8),11)
```


## Usage

To fit curves to a batch of raw data, you need to supply the `fit_data()` function with the meta file. This can either be with the file path or by setting the working directory to where the data lives. If no path is supplied the function assumes all data is in the working directory. All output/results are exported to the same directory as the meta file.

In addition, the user can supply the function with a text batch_id, this is used to prefix the output file names. This is advisable to avoid accumulating result files with the same name and makes searching results easier, particularity if analysis is run a second time on a filtered meta file.

```{r run, echo = TRUE, results = 'hide'}
#use example files
meta <- batchCurve_example("example_meta.csv")

l <- fit_data(file_path = meta, prefix = 'example1')
```


This function will provide some console feedback on the analysis progress. Once complete, two objects are exported to csv file and also returned in a list. **note:** The first assay in the example data set is artificial and designed to fail fitting!

1. A **prefix**_results.csv' file containing the meta data and model coefficient columns appended. This data frame is also returned as the first item in a list for further analysis, here each row still represents 1 assay. A unique identifier (IC50_key) is assigned to avoid clashes between repeat assays and link to the assay data.

```{r}
m <- l[[1]]
head(m, 10)[,c(1,6,8,13,20)]
```


2. Normalised measurements and dose in uM are exported and the unique IC50_key links it back to the assay coefficients data frame.

```{r}
d <- l[[2]]
head(d, 10)
```

## Quality Control

The standard Hill model enables generating sigmoidal curves that capture dose-response data in most cases. However, this is not appropriate in cases with multiple points of inflection, i.e multiphasic data. It is important for users to visually assess both the assay quality and the fit quality of their data before accepting an IC50 value.

A separate function for plotting the data and models is included in batchCurve, `plot_fit()`. This functionality is separated from the model fitting procedure to allow the user the option to re-plot the results after some manipulation, i.e you want to filter some failed assays out or merge multiple batches together.

See `vignette("visualise models")` for a walk through of this procedure.
